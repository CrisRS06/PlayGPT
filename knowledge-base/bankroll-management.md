# Bankroll Management: The Science of Bet Sizing

## Introduction

Bankroll management is arguably more important than finding +EV bets. Even with perfect betting skill, poor bankroll management can lead to ruin. Conversely, disciplined bankroll management allows you to survive variance and profit long-term from even modest edges.

**Key Principle:** Your betting strategy must balance maximizing profit with minimizing risk of ruin.

## What is a Bankroll?

Your **bankroll** is the total amount of money dedicated specifically to sports betting. This money should be:

- **Separate** from living expenses, savings, and emergency funds
- **Disposable** income you can afford to lose entirely
- **Dedicated** solely to betting (not mixed with daily spending money)

**Critical Rule:** Never bet with money you cannot afford to lose.

## The Risk of Ruin

**Risk of Ruin (RoR):** The probability that you will lose your entire bankroll before achieving your profit goals.

Even with a genuine edge (+EV betting), you can go broke due to:
1. **Variance (bad luck)** - Losing streaks happen even with +EV bets
2. **Overbetting** - Bet sizes too large relative to edge and bankroll
3. **Undercapitalization** - Bankroll too small to withstand normal variance

**Example:**
- You have a 2% edge (very good!)
- You bet 20% of bankroll per bet
- Even with a 2% edge, your risk of ruin is ~40%

**Key Insight:** Proper bet sizing dramatically reduces risk of ruin while still allowing profit.

## Bankroll Management Strategies

### 1. Fixed Unit Betting (Beginner Friendly)

**Method:** Bet the same dollar amount on every wager.

**Example:**
- Bankroll: $1,000
- Unit size: $20 (2% of bankroll)
- Every bet is $20, regardless of confidence or odds

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Protects against emotional variance
- Easy to track performance

**Cons:**
- Doesn't adjust for confidence level
- Doesn't scale with bankroll growth/decline
- Not optimal for long-term profit

**Recommended Unit Size:** 1-2% of bankroll

### 2. Percentage of Bankroll (Dynamic Staking)

**Method:** Bet a fixed percentage of your current bankroll.

**Example:**
- Starting bankroll: $1,000
- Bet size: 2% of current bankroll
- Bet 1: $20 (2% of $1,000)
- After win (+$20): New bankroll = $1,020 → Next bet = $20.40
- After loss (-$20): New bankroll = $980 → Next bet = $19.60

**Pros:**
- Automatically adjusts to bankroll changes
- Prevents betting too much when losing
- Allows compound growth when winning

**Cons:**
- Requires frequent recalculation
- Can be psychologically difficult to reduce bet sizes

**Recommended Percentage:** 1-3% per bet

### 3. Kelly Criterion (Advanced)

**Method:** Bet a percentage of bankroll proportional to your edge.

**Formula:**
**Kelly % = (Edge / Odds)**

Where:
- **Edge** = (Your win probability) - (Market implied probability)
- **Odds** = Decimal odds - 1

**Example:**
- You estimate 55% win probability
- Market odds: -110 (implied 52.4%)
- Edge = 55% - 52.4% = 2.6%
- Odds (decimal) = 1.909, so odds - 1 = 0.909
- Kelly % = 2.6% / 0.909 = **2.86% of bankroll**

**Pros:**
- Mathematically optimal for long-term growth
- Maximizes compounding
- Adjusts bet size to confidence and edge

**Cons:**
- Requires accurate probability estimation (hard!)
- Full Kelly has high variance
- Overestimating edge leads to overbetting

**Recommendation:** Use **fractional Kelly** (25% to 50% of full Kelly) to reduce variance.

**Example:**
- Full Kelly says bet 2.86%
- Half Kelly = 1.43% (more conservative, less variance)

### 4. Confidence-Based Staking

**Method:** Bet more on high-confidence plays, less on low-confidence plays.

**Example:**
- High confidence: 3% of bankroll
- Medium confidence: 2% of bankroll
- Low confidence: 1% of bankroll

**Pros:**
- Intuitive and flexible
- Accounts for edge differences
- Easy to implement

**Cons:**
- Subjective (confidence ≠ accuracy)
- Can be influenced by bias
- Risk of overconfidence

**Warning:** Studies show bettors' confidence often doesn't correlate with accuracy. Be honest about your true edge.

## Common Bankroll Management Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Betting Too Much Per Bet

**The Problem:**
- Betting 10%+ per wager creates massive variance
- One bad losing streak can wipe out the bankroll
- Even with an edge, risk of ruin is high

**Example:**
- Bankroll: $1,000
- Bet size: $200 (20% of bankroll)
- 5 losses in a row (which will happen!) = **Bankroll destroyed**

**Solution:** Never bet more than 5% of bankroll on a single bet.

### Mistake 2: Chasing Losses

**The Problem:**
- After losses, increasing bet sizes to "get even"
- Emotional decision-making replaces disciplined strategy
- Often results in larger losses

**Example:**
- Lose $100 → Bet $200 to "win it back"
- Lose $200 → Bet $500
- Now down $800 from $200 worth of bad decisions

**Solution:** Stick to your betting plan regardless of recent results.

### Mistake 3: Not Adjusting for Bankroll Changes

**The Problem:**
- Starting with $1,000 and betting $20/game (2%)
- After growing to $2,000, still betting $20 (now 1%)
- After dropping to $500, still betting $20 (now 4%)

**Solution:** Recalculate unit size weekly or monthly based on current bankroll.

### Mistake 4: Mixing Bankroll with Living Money

**The Problem:**
- Betting rent money, savings, emergency funds
- Leads to emotional decisions (must win to pay bills)
- Creates unsustainable stress

**Solution:** Bankroll must be separate, disposable income.

### Mistake 5: No Defined Bankroll

**The Problem:**
- "I'll bet whatever I feel like"
- No discipline or tracking
- Easy to lose track of total losses

**Solution:** Define a fixed bankroll and track every bet.

## Advanced Concepts

### Variance and Standard Deviation

Even with +EV betting, short-term results vary widely.

**Example:**
- 100 bets with 55% win rate
- Expected: 55 wins, 45 losses
- Possible range: 40-70 wins (due to normal variance)

**Standard Deviation in Sports Betting:**
- Typical bet: ~1 standard deviation = 10% of stake
- Meaning: ~68% of results fall within ±10%

**Key Takeaway:** Downswings of 20-30 units are normal, even with an edge.

### Bankroll Requirements for Survival

**Rule of Thumb:** Your bankroll should be at least **50-100 betting units**.

**Example:**
- If you bet $20/game, your bankroll should be $1,000-$2,000
- If you have $500, your unit size should be $5-$10

**Why?**
- Allows you to survive normal losing streaks
- Reduces risk of ruin to under 1%
- Enables long-term profit realization

### The Kelly Criterion Deep Dive

**Full Kelly Example:**
- Your win probability: 53%
- Opponent win probability: 47%
- Odds: +100 (even money)
- Edge: 53% - 50% = 3%

**Kelly Calculation:**
Kelly % = ((0.53 × 2) - 1) / 1 = 0.06 or **6% of bankroll**

**Why Fractional Kelly?**
- Full Kelly assumes your probability estimates are perfect (they're not)
- Overestimating probability by even 2% leads to massive overbetting
- Half Kelly or Quarter Kelly reduces variance by 50-75%

**Real-World Application:**
Most professionals use 20-50% of Kelly (never full Kelly).

## Bankroll Growth and Compounding

With proper bankroll management, you can achieve exponential growth.

**Example: 2% Edge, 2% Unit Size, 100 Bets**
- Starting bankroll: $1,000
- Win rate: 52% (with -110 odds)
- Expected profit per bet: ~$2
- After 100 bets: ~$1,200 (20% ROI)

**Compounding Effect:**
- Year 1: $1,000 → $1,500
- Year 2: $1,500 → $2,250
- Year 3: $2,250 → $3,375
- Over time, compounding accelerates growth

**Key:** Consistently reinvest profits and maintain disciplined bet sizing.

## Stop-Loss Limits

**Definition:** A predetermined threshold where you stop betting for a set period.

**Examples:**
- **Daily stop-loss:** Stop if down 2 units in one day
- **Weekly stop-loss:** Stop if down 10% of bankroll in a week
- **Losing streak limit:** Stop after 5 consecutive losses

**Purpose:**
- Prevents emotional tilt
- Protects against bad decision-making during variance
- Forces you to reassess strategy

**Recommended:**
- Stop if down 20% of starting bankroll
- Take a break for at least a week
- Analyze what went wrong (bad luck vs bad process)

## Bankroll Building Tips

### Start Small
- Begin with a modest bankroll ($500-$1,000)
- Focus on learning, not profit
- Track performance rigorously

### Add to Bankroll from Income
- Deposit regularly from disposable income
- Don't rely on winnings to grow bankroll
- Treat early deposits as "tuition" for learning

### Never Withdraw Until Significant Growth
- Set a growth target (e.g., 50% profit) before withdrawing
- Let compounding work its magic
- Premature withdrawals slow growth

### Separate Recreational vs Serious Bankrolls
- Recreational: Smaller bankroll, looser discipline
- Serious: Larger bankroll, strict discipline and tracking

## Practical Bankroll Guidelines by Experience

### Beginner ($500-$1,000 bankroll)
- Unit size: $10-$20 (2% of bankroll)
- Focus: Learning, tracking, discipline
- Goal: Break even while building skills

### Intermediate ($1,000-$5,000 bankroll)
- Unit size: $20-$100 (2% of bankroll)
- Focus: Refining strategy, identifying edges
- Goal: 5-10% ROI

### Advanced ($5,000+ bankroll)
- Unit size: $100-$500 (1-2% of bankroll, possibly Kelly)
- Focus: Maximizing edge, line shopping, modeling
- Goal: 10%+ ROI

## Key Takeaways

1. **Separate bankroll from living expenses** - Only bet disposable income.

2. **Bet 1-3% per wager** - Protects against variance.

3. **Risk of ruin is real** - Even with an edge, poor sizing leads to bankruptcy.

4. **Kelly Criterion is optimal but risky** - Use fractional Kelly (25-50%).

5. **Variance is normal** - Expect 20-30 unit downswings.

6. **Compounding accelerates growth** - Reinvest profits for exponential returns.

7. **Discipline beats skill without it** - Stick to the plan, always.

8. **Track everything** - Know your true ROI, win rate, and unit performance.

## Practice Problems

1. You have a $2,000 bankroll. Using 2% unit size, what should you bet per game?

2. You estimate 54% win probability on a -110 line. Calculate full Kelly percentage.

3. Your bankroll drops from $1,000 to $700. If using 2% unit sizing, what's your new bet size?

4. You have a 5-game losing streak. Should you increase bet sizes to recoup losses? Why or why not?
