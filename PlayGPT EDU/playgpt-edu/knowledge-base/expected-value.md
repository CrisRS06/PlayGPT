# Expected Value: The Foundation of Rational Betting

## Introduction

Expected Value (EV) is the most fundamental concept in gambling and betting strategy. It represents the average outcome you can expect from a bet if you were to make it repeatedly over time. Understanding EV is crucial for distinguishing between smart bets and poor decisions.

## What is Expected Value?

Expected Value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing the results. The formula is:

**EV = (Probability of Winning × Amount Won) - (Probability of Losing × Amount Lost)**

### Example 1: Simple Coin Flip

Imagine a fair coin flip where:
- You win $2 if it lands on heads
- You lose $1 if it lands on tails
- Probability of heads = 50% (0.5)
- Probability of tails = 50% (0.5)

**Calculation:**
EV = (0.5 × $2) - (0.5 × $1)
EV = $1 - $0.50
EV = +$0.50

This bet has a **positive expected value** of $0.50, meaning on average, you gain 50 cents per flip over many iterations.

### Example 2: NFL Point Spread Bet

Consider an NFL bet with -110 odds (standard):
- You bet $110 to win $100
- You believe your team has a 55% chance to cover the spread
- Probability of winning = 0.55
- Probability of losing = 0.45

**Calculation:**
EV = (0.55 × $100) - (0.45 × $110)
EV = $55 - $49.50
EV = +$5.50

This bet has a **positive EV** of $5.50 per $110 wagered, representing a 5% return on investment.

## Positive vs Negative Expected Value

### Positive EV (+EV)
- The average outcome is profitable over time
- You have an edge over the bookmaker
- This is what professional bettors seek

### Negative EV (-EV)
- The average outcome loses money over time
- The bookmaker has an edge over you
- Most casual bets fall into this category
- Casino games (except counting cards in blackjack) are always -EV

### Zero EV
- Break-even proposition
- Rare in real-world gambling due to house edge/vig

## The Vig (Vigorish) and Why Most Bets Are -EV

Bookmakers build in a margin called the "vig" or "juice" to ensure they profit. In NFL betting, standard odds are -110, meaning you risk $110 to win $100.

**If betting was fair (no vig):**
- 50/50 outcome would be +100 odds (even money)
- You bet $100 to win $100

**With -110 odds:**
- You need to win 52.4% of the time just to break even
- Below 52.4% win rate = negative EV
- This 2.4% edge is the bookmaker's profit margin

## Why Expected Value Matters More Than Single Results

Many bettors make the mistake of judging decisions by results rather than process. A +EV bet can lose, and a -EV bet can win, but over time:

- +EV bets will be profitable
- -EV bets will lose money

**Example: The Lottery Fallacy**

Imagine someone wins $10 million on a lottery ticket that cost $2. They say, "That was a great decision!" But was it?

- Probability of winning: 1 in 50,000,000 (0.00000002)
- Expected Value: (0.00000002 × $10,000,000) - (0.99999998 × $2)
- EV = $0.20 - $2 = **-$1.80**

Despite the massive win, the decision had an EV of -$1.80, meaning it was a terrible bet. They got lucky, but the process was flawed.

## How to Find Positive EV Bets

### 1. Accurate Probability Assessment
You must estimate the true probability of an outcome more accurately than the market (bookmakers).

**Market says:** Team A has 45% chance to win (-110 odds)
**Your analysis:** Team A actually has 52% chance to win

This discrepancy creates +EV opportunity.

### 2. Line Shopping
Different bookmakers offer different odds. Always get the best price.

**Bookmaker A:** Patriots -3 (-115)
**Bookmaker B:** Patriots -3 (-105)

Betting at -105 instead of -115 significantly improves your EV.

### 3. Exploit Market Inefficiencies
- Public bias (overvaluing favorites)
- Recency bias (overreacting to last game)
- Home team bias
- Betting trends and line movement

## Common Mistakes in EV Thinking

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Sample Size
One winning bet doesn't prove it was +EV. You need hundreds of bets to evaluate your edge.

### Mistake 2: Confusing Probability with Certainty
A 70% favorite will lose 30% of the time. That's not bad luck—it's expected variance.

### Mistake 3: The Gambler's Fallacy
Past results don't affect future independent events. A coin that landed heads 5 times in a row still has 50% probability of heads on the next flip.

### Mistake 4: Only Caring About Wins
A 90% win rate can be unprofitable if your losses are massive and wins are small.

**Example:**
- 9 winning bets: +$10 each = +$90
- 1 losing bet: -$200 = -$200
- **Net result: -$110** despite 90% win rate

## Practical Application: NFL Betting

Let's apply EV thinking to a real NFL scenario.

**Scenario:** Kansas City Chiefs vs Buffalo Bills

**Market Odds:**
- Chiefs -3.5 (-110)
- Bills +3.5 (-110)

**Your Analysis:**
After studying team stats, injuries, weather, and trends, you estimate:
- Chiefs have 48% chance to cover -3.5
- Bills have 52% chance to cover +3.5

**EV Calculation for Bills +3.5:**
- Win probability: 52% (0.52)
- Lose probability: 48% (0.48)
- Bet $110 to win $100

EV = (0.52 × $100) - (0.48 × $110)
EV = $52 - $52.80
EV = -$0.80

**Result:** Even though you favor the Bills, the -110 odds make this a slightly -EV bet. You'd need to estimate at least 52.4% probability to make it +EV.

## Key Takeaways

1. **EV is the only metric that matters long-term** - Results of individual bets are misleading.

2. **The vig makes most bets -EV** - You need a true edge to overcome bookmaker margins.

3. **Process over results** - Judge decisions by EV, not outcomes.

4. **Positive EV ≠ Guaranteed profit** - Variance means you can lose even with +EV bets, but you'll profit over time.

5. **Accurate probability estimation is key** - Your edge comes from better analysis than the market.

6. **Bankroll management complements EV** - Even +EV bets can cause ruin with poor bet sizing (covered in Bankroll Management module).

## Practice Problems

1. A bet offers 3:1 odds (+300). You estimate 30% win probability. Is this +EV?

2. You find a -110 line you estimate has 55% win probability. What's your EV per $100 bet?

3. Why is a parlay with two 50% probability events at 3:1 odds (-EV)?
